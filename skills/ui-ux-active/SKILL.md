# Actions (active) and "Warn, but Recover"

Friction increases with **consequence, scope, and irreversibility**. Each action ends with a
result, a way back, and a next step (forgiveness pattern, peak-end principle).

## Buttons

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `action.primary` | One per area, verb + noun ("Create record"), never "OK" |
| `action.secondary` | Cancel, alternatives; placed before the primary action |
| `action.danger` | Separate from everyday actions, at the bottom of the menu; never default, never on Enter |
| `action.pending` | Button shows progress; a second click has no effect |
| `action.hidden` | No permission → hide. Frontend permissions are convenience only; the backend always checks |
| `action.blocked` | Blocked by state → hint with a way out (state, action, button to resolve, "How it works"); the button points to it via `aria-describedby` |

## Warn, but Recover

Sequence: `action.warn` (early) → `action.notice` (inline) → `action.warn` (escalated) →
`action.confirm` → `action.success` + `action.undo`. **Routine actions skip everything up to
`action.success`.**

Decision, top to bottom, the first "yes" wins:

| Question | Yes → |
|---|---|
| 1. Reversible? | Execute immediately, `action.undo` (undo ≥ 10 s) |
| 2. Still referenced (other records, documents, links)? | `action.deactivate`: offer only "Deactivate"; "Delete" appears only when nothing points to it any more |
| 3. Can it be cushioned? | Trash with a retention period, versions, audit log; then as 1 |
| 4. Would a mistake be serious? | `action.confirm`: consequence with object, count, names **before** confirming |
| 5. Worst case catastrophic and rare (delete permanently, send to an external office)? | Multi-layered: confirmation + log; `action.confirmTyped` (type the name) only here |

Also: frequent action → keep it light; user in flow (data entry, writing) → do not interrupt
with a modal. Do not add artificial waiting times.

**Rule:** protect catastrophic and hard-to-fix actions; provide a way back for everything that
is easily undone.

## `action.success` and `action.failed`

- Specific: "Letter sent to Anna Weber.", not "Action completed".
- Undo **and** the next sensible step as a button; offer undo only when it works reliably.
- Failure: what is kept, what works now, "Try again"; without technical jargon or blame (`../ui-ux/references/helpful-feedback.md`).

In detail (four strategies, mistakes, measuring): `references/warn-but-recover.md`.

## Accessibility

- Announce success and undo via a live region; the message does **not** take focus.
- The undo message stays while hovered/focused, can be closed, and is keyboard reachable (WCAG 2.2.1).
- After the action: focus a sensible target (neighbouring row, heading), never lost.
- Button names unambiguous without context ("Delete record Weber" in the row menu).

## Responsive

- At 375 px the primary action stays visible; further actions go into the menu.
- Stacked buttons: the safe action is reached first, the dangerous one not under the thumb.

## Checklist per dangerous action

- [ ] Would undo or deactivate suffice instead of a confirmation?
- [ ] Consequence names object, count, names before confirming?
- [ ] The safe option is default and has initial focus?
- [ ] Success with undo **and** next step?
- [ ] Keyboard, announcement, focus afterwards checked?
- [ ] Worst case protected in several layers?

Heuristics (`../ui-ux/references/masters.md`): H3 control and freedom, H5 error prevention,
H9 a way out when blocked (`action.blocked`).

Implementation: mapping of the keys in the design-system mapping
(`ui-ux/references/design-system-mapping.md`).
