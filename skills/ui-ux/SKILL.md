name: ui-ux
description: Entry point of the UI/UX Behaves suite. Use when a page, flow, table, form, dialog, tabs, notification, date input or setting is planned, built, reviewed or described as a ticket with acceptance criteria, or when states (empty, loading, error, warning) are missing.

# UI/UX Behaves

The suite is fixed. **Only the design system is interchangeable.** The sub-skills speak in behaves
(`table.noResults`, `field.invalid`) and token roles ("error colour", "spacing 05"), never in the
components of a particular design system. Which component implements a behave is written once in
the design-system mapping (`references/design-system-mapping.md`, copied into your design-system
skill and filled in). Switching design systems means a new mapping with the same keys.

## Sub-skills

| Topic | Skill |
|---|---|
| List, table | `ui-ux-table` |
| Form, field, toggle | `ui-ux-form` |
| Date, time, range | `ui-ux-date` |
| User action, delete, send, permissions | `ui-ux-active` |
| System feedback, loading, notification | `ui-ux-passive` |
| Tabs | `ui-ux-tabs` |
| Dialog, side panel | `ui-ux-dialog` |
| Chart, key figure, report | `ui-ux-chart` |

## Behave grid

Every state gets a key `context.state[.severity]` and sits on three axes:

- **Phase:** idle → interact → processing → outcome → recovery → done
- **Semantics:** info · success · warning · error · progress · empty · blocked
- **Trigger:** on-input · on-blur · on-submit · on-async · timed · on-focus

All keys: `references/behave-catalog.md`. A new state is added there first, then mapped in the
design-system mapping.

**Required for every container** (page, table, form, dialog): `loading`, `empty`, `ready`, `error`,
plus `warning` wherever there is risk. Further behaves only where harm or frequency justify them.

## Tools

The plugin ships text only; the checks run with your own search and read tools.

- `/ui-ux-behaves:audit`: counts source patterns that break behaves (spinner over an area, toggle
  in a submitted form, disabled submit, "Are you sure?") and works as a ratchet. Patterns come
  from a config per design system; example for Carbon React in the plugin's `examples/`.
- `/ui-ux-behaves:copy-check`: finds the same word repeated in elements close together, from
  rendered text or an aria snapshot.
- Mapping check: compare the keys between the `behave-keys` markers of `references/behave-catalog.md`
  and of your design-system mapping. Every catalog key appears exactly once, none is left empty,
  and the mapping has no keys the catalog does not know.

- `/ui-ux-behaves:review`: one screen against the behaves and the masters, heuristics H1 to H10
  answered one by one.
- `/ui-ux-behaves:walkthrough`: one task step by step from a newcomer's view, four questions per
  step (cognitive walkthrough, `references/cognitive-walkthrough.md`).

The audit only finds patterns. A clean run does not prove that states exist; that is the review.

## Who uses the app

Before designing, write down the roles, the setting (office, field, phone) and how often people are
interrupted, from evidence: user messages, tickets with acceptance criteria, usage logs, legacy data,
help pages, domain rules. Everything else is an assumption with its cheapest test. No invented
personas or numbers.

**Depth of method:** convention or bug → finding, severity, fix. Core or costly task → cognitive
walkthrough of that task before release. New page with an open question → brief, three concepts,
recommendation in a plan document. Large initiative without a task → frame it first.

## Principles of the masters (apply everywhere)

Norman, Nielsen, Gestalt and UX writing, with check questions and cases: `references/masters.md`.

- **Mapping and feedback:** the effect is visible where the user acts. If it happens elsewhere, the
  label says where (no "basement switch").
- **Stable frame:** header, menu and side navigation stay the same on every tab; sudden empty space
  reads as contrast.
- **Proximity and white space:** spacing shows what belongs together; white space is intended,
  never a leftover.
- **No stuttering:** the same word not twice in close proximity; the heading carries the term.

## Accessibility (applies everywhere)

Target WCAG 2.2 AA. Every control has a name, role and state; focus is visible, order follows
meaning, and focus is set deliberately after dialogs and errors; messages use a live region; never
colour alone. Check with axe in an end-to-end test (nothing "serious" or "critical") and a keyboard
walkthrough. Never claim "compliant" from a scan alone.

## Responsive (applies everywhere)

Desktop first for office software: 1280 px full, 1024 px good, 375 px read and main action; usable
at 200 % zoom; never scroll horizontally. Translations can be about 30 % longer. Every sub-skill
says what drops away on narrow screens.

## Language (applies everywhere)

Sentence case, no full stop at the end of labels, buttons and titles. Buttons are verb + noun
("Save changes"), never "OK". Use the terms of the users' daily work, not the system's internals
(H2). Say it once: what the heading already says is not repeated below it (H8).

## Help (applies everywhere)

Every flow has help made of concrete steps, reachable from the page where the flow starts, and
searchable (H10). Help in context comes first: format next to the field, a "How it works" link at a
blocked action, more help after the same error repeats. Frequent users get shortcuts and remembered
settings, and hints they dismissed stay dismissed (H7). A help page is not an excuse for a screen
that cannot be understood without it.

## Acceptance criteria

Numbered, observable; each becomes a test step:

- "Given [situation], when [action], then [visible result]."
- "With the keyboard alone, one can [task] without [obstacle]."
- "A screen reader announces [name/state/message]."
- "If [operation] fails, [data] is kept and [way out] is offered."
- "At [width/zoom], [content] stays readable and usable."
