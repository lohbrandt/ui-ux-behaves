# Forms

Principle: **validate late, report close, never lose input.** Errors sit at the field, not in a
toast; every error says how to get it right.

## Field behaves

| Key | Rule | Trap |
|---|---|---|
| `field.focus` | Focus clearly visible | Focus ring removed by styling |
| `field.validating` | "Checking …" only for server checks (duplicate, reference number) | Check on every keystroke |
| `field.valid` | Success only for hard fields (password, IBAN checksum) | Green tick on every field |
| `field.invalid` | Message at the field: problem + solution ("A German IBAN has 22 characters") | "Invalid input" |
| `field.warning` | Non-fatal: allow, warn ("Date falls on a weekend") | Warning blocks saving |
| `field.optional` | Required is the norm; optional is marked "(optional)" | Asterisk without explanation |
| `field.readonly` / `field.disabled` | Always say why (permission, status) | Silent grey |
| `field.override` | Check can be overridden for address/phone; never for IBAN or reference numbers | User cannot proceed |
| `field.repeatedError` | From the 3rd identical error, more help (example, help link) | Same text over and over |

**Timing:** validate on leaving the field (`on-blur`) and on submit. While typing only to remove an
error already shown. Parse tolerantly: spaces, groups, upper/lower case.

## Form behaves

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `form.errorSummary` | On submit with errors: summary at the top with links to the fields, focus on the summary or the first field; never the only indication |
| `form.submitting` | Submit button shows progress, double click has no effect |
| `form.submitSuccess` | Specific, with next step (`ui-ux-active`) |
| `form.submitFailed` | Input stays, reason in user language, "Try again" |
| `form.dirty` / `form.dirtyGuard` | Unsaved changes visible; ask on leaving ("Discard changes" / "Keep editing") |
| `form.autosave` | Where interruptions are frequent (data entry on the phone): draft saved automatically, state visible ("Saved 10:42") |

**Default: the submit button stays enabled.** A disabled button does not explain what is missing,
cannot be focused by keyboard users and is often missed by screen readers. Pressing it shows the
field errors and the summary instead (`form.errorSummary`). Exceptions where disabling is fine:

- While sending (`form.submitting`), to prevent a double submit; the button shows progress.
- A short form (one to three fields, all visible) where the missing input is obvious and a hint next
  to the button says what is needed, for example a search with one field.
- A block that the user cannot resolve in the form (no right, a closed period): then a visible hint
  with the reason and a way out (`action.blocked`).

Whatever the case, the reason is visible on screen, not only in a tooltip.

**Toggles** take effect immediately, without a save button. The label says what happens and where
("Show in lists"), not only the object. If the toggle acts outside the page, the help text below
names the place, ideally with a link. No toggle for something that only applies after submitting;
use a checkbox or a choice instead (mapping, feedback: `ui-ux/references/masters.md`).

Concurrent editing: conflict protection instead of silent overwriting (`status.conflict`).

## Accessibility

- Every field has a visible label (a placeholder is not a label); help and error connected via
  `aria-describedby`, invalid via `aria-invalid`.
- The error summary is announced; links jump into the field.
- `autocomplete` and a matching input mode (email, number, phone).
- Order of fields = reading order = tab order.

## Responsive

- Form in a narrow column (about half width) at 1280 px; at 375 px single column, full width.
- Buttons not covered by the on-screen keyboard; error summary stays reachable at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Validating while typing; errors as toast or tooltip.
- Form cleared after a server error.
- Disabled submit button without a reason.
- Required-field errors on first opening.
- A toggle whose effect cannot be seen and whose label does not say where it happens.

## Checklist

- [ ] Validation on-blur + on-submit, message at the field with a solution?
- [ ] Error summary with links and focus?
- [ ] Server error: input kept, "Try again"?
- [ ] Leave guard for unsaved changes?
- [ ] Labels, `autocomplete`, announcements checked; single column at 375 px?

Heuristics (`../ui-ux/references/masters.md`): H2 the users' words (toggle label names the effect), H5 error prevention, H6 recognition,
H9 recover from errors, H10 help after repeated errors (`field.repeatedError`).

Implementation: mapping of the keys in the design-system mapping (`ui-ux/references/design-system-mapping.md`).
